I have developed a shopping app named QuickCart in Java, utilizing Firebase as the database. QuickCart features robust user authentication with Firebase, complete with proper error and exception handling. The app includes a search bar that leverages Firebase Storage to locate products, allowing users to add items to their cart, adjust quantities, and remove items as needed. All cart operations are synchronized with Firebase Storage to store user data. The appâ€™s data, including text and images, is dynamically fetched from Firestore.

QuickCart boasts a smooth navigation bar showcasing all app options, enhanced by a responsive progress bar. Users can view selected items in their cart, proceed to purchase by clicking the "Buy Now" button, and update their profile with a profile picture, which is securely stored in the database along with other personal data.
